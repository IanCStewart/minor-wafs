# The Pros and Cons of jQuery
_and other JS libraries_
> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript. ~[jQuery docs](https://jquery.com)

## Pros
